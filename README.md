# Typing_test
Typing is a practical skill that in todays day and age needs to be developed. With the sheer amount of typing needed in todays industries, it cannot be avoided. For example, the average person types at 40 words per minute. Meaning that if you had to write a two page document containing around 1250 words, it would the average person around 30 minutes to type (excluding the thinking behind what to type). While a person (like me) with an average typing speed of 120 words per minute, can type that two page document in ten minutes; a third of the average Joe's time. It has been a skill I mostly practiced over 2020 and one that will remain for the foreseeable future. Here is a typing test to improve and test typing speed and accuracy.
