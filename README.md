## About

In today's digital age, typing proficiency is an essential skill across various industries. This project provides a web-based typing test to help users improve their typing speed and accuracy.

### Why Typing Speed Matters

- The average person types at 40 words per minute (WPM).
- A two-page document (about 1250 words) takes an average person 30 minutes to type.
- An efficient typist at 120 WPM can complete the same task in just 10 minutes.

Developing this skill can significantly boost productivity in many professional and personal tasks.

## Features

- Real-time typing test with random word generation
- WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation
- Accuracy measurement
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect keystrokes
- Infinitely scrolling text for extended practice
- 30-second timed tests

## Setup and Installation

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/typing-test.git
   cd typing-test
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the application locally.

3. For development, you may want to use a local server. If you have Python installed, you can use:
